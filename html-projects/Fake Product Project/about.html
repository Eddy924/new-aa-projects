  <h1>About Bread Dispenser & Co.</h1>
  <p>
    Bread dispenser & co. was founded in 1957 by
    John Doe, John was an ordinary man living in rural Ohio. One day, John decided that he wanted to dispense bread from
    a kitchen device. This is where we got the bread dispenser, the first official product of Bread Dispenser & Co. We
    later began building more products as our team of engineers and employees grew. Today, we are located in every US
    State, and in major retailers such as Walmart, and other stores near you.
